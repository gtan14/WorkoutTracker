# WorkoutTracker

This is the source code for my Android application Workout Tracker, that utilizes Google Firebase to allow users to create custom workouts. Workouts are automatically saved to the cloud, and Google Cloud Functions is used to allow users to share workouts with one another.

You can view it in the Google Play store using the URL

Or you can view it in the Play store on your mobile device by searching com.geraldtan.workouttracker
